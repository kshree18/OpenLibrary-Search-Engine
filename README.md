We have developed a web application using Python Web Development Framework called 'Streamlit' that is popularly used for data analytics and ML purposes. Further details can be found here : https://streamlit.io/ 

This web application performs a HTTP Request to Open Libraries API to query for the search terms and returns the results. The search term could be book title or author name.


Prequisites : 

1. OS - Platform Independent i.e. Linux or Windows 

2. Python3 

3. Pip3


Clone this repository with git clone command & run the following commands to prepare your environment : 

1. Install Python3 from the following link  (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or for linux python3 is present by default.

2. Install Pip - sudo apt install python3-pip, for windows this is present in python downloaded folder

3. Pip install -r requirements.txt 

4. Python3 -m streamlit run app.py

Now the web app should be running in the localhost on port 8051 i.e., http://localhost:8051 visit this and search for your desired books. 

This is also publicly hosted at : http://35.188.140.73:8501/

Future planned improvements : 

1. Dockerize App 

2. UI Development

3. Alternate enriched API adoption 

4. Local DB for faster results
