# OpenLibrary-Search-Engine
Venmurasu Qualifier Contest Project
We have developed a web application using Python Web Development Framework called 'Streamlit' that is popularly used for data analytics and ML purposes. Further details can be found here : https://streamlit.io/ 
This web application performs a HTTP Request to Open Libraries API to query for the search terms and returns the results. The search term could be book title or author name.

The prerequisites to install the application are as follows : 
 OS - Platform Independent can be run on Linux or Windows 
 Run the following commands to Prepare your environment : 
   1.Install Python3 from the following link  (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or for linux python3 is present by default.
   2. Python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 

Download the file app.py and in the downloaded folder run python3 -m streamlit run app.py
Now the web app should be running in the localhost on port 8051 i.e., http://localhost:8051 visit this and search for your desired books
Future planned improvements : 
1. Dockerize App 
2. UI Development
3. Alternate enriched API adoption 
4. Local DB for faster results
